# braveTogether
This Android app is currently under development.
The application will be used by "brave together" project participants to create videos and conduct the parade.

The application provides a video creation interface in which a Holocaust survivor will display a story number according to 3 guiding questions. 
The app will consolidate the videos and merge them with slides that describe the questions. 
The final video will be uploaded to a dedicated YouTube channel.
