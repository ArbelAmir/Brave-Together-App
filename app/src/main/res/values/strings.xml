    <string name="video_instruction_text">Recording a video is a way to pass on the bravery and
        courage that holocaust survivors showed during World War II. \n\n The video is built of
        three parts, each one about 30 seconds long. In each section you will be asked to answer
        the following questions: \n\n1. Tell us about a struggle you had during the holocaust.
        \n2. What helped you overcome that struggle? \n3. What do you want the future generations
        to remember? \n\nAfter recording each segment you have an option to view the recording and
        create a new one if you aren’t satisfied with what you filmed. Once you record all three
        pieces, they will be merged into one video that will be uploaded to the BraveTogether
        YouTube channel. In addition, they’ll be an option for you to share the video with your
        friends and family on FaceBook.</string>
